the passion project that almost haven't seen the light of day, but it's still something i want to share if you want to look

this was just a passion project i worked on some time ago

you can try compiling it with cmake there shouldn't be an issue on linux. windows ... eh idk from what i see dsl has windows code in place who knows if it will work

the rendering stuff is done via dsl (very simple alternative to sdl or sth i made)

project also uses custom assets format .pbs, you can look into them using pbs viewer you can compile inside pbs/ folder

it's not really much but still it was my first serious attempt at making own a game without any game engin, it's under MIT (there doesn't seam to be any not mine/mit code here afaik) so you can use everything here to do whatever you like

if you want give me some feedback on this in issue, keep in mind it turned out to be more of a technical demo than, so look more into code than gameplay

one day i might come back to this (that's why this repo says legacy) but who know

thank you for having a look <3
