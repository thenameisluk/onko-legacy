dsl diffrent standard library
(wip as i write it so no links)

coded and delivered by L team
code by luk the oop programmer
debbugged by zoz the glaceon

pokemon in the game but we
can treat him as a rubber
duck right?)

comment thingies but yes

without premission but if
you want you can modify code
itself so yes i hope it's
